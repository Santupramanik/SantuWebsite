## My First HTML & CSS Project

This is the first web project I ever created, back when I was in class 7. It is a simple HTML and CSS project that helped me understand the basics of web development. Although the design and code are quite basic compared to what I do now, it was the starting point of my journey into the world of web development.

### Project Overview

- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS
- **Description**: This project showcases my early experimentation with web design. I learned the fundamental concepts of structuring content with HTML and styling with CSS.
- **Date Created**: 2021

### Why I Kept This Project

As I look back, it reminds me of how much I’ve learned over the years and how far I’ve come. It shows my progress, from basic web design to more advanced techniques I am now working on. I hope this can inspire others to start building and experimenting with web technologies, regardless of their skill level.

### Looking Ahead

Since this was my first project, my skills have greatly improved. I am currently working on more advanced projects and refining my knowledge in front-end development. Feel free to check out my other repositories to see my growth!
