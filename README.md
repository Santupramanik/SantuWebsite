# 🎉 My First HTML & CSS Project

This is the first web project I ever created, back when I was in class 7. It is a simple HTML and CSS project that helped me understand the basics of web development. Although the design and code are quite basic compared to what I do now, it was the starting point of my journey into the world of web development. 🌱
